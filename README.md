# SNU-ACM Hackit Git Workshop March 2016

This was the 9th session of the HackIt! series. The talk focused on git version control and how to use git to collaborate on GitHub with other developers, and a little bit about the open source and free software movement. Students were given a walkthrough and all of them walked out with a working git installation and their attendance marked by forking this repository and sending pull requests.

The talk was conducted by [Karan Sharma](http://github.com/mr-karan) and was assisted by [Rohan Verma](http://github.com/rhnvrm) at Shiv Nadar University by the [ACM Student Chapter](https://github.com/ACM-SNU).
